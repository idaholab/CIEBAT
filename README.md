##CIEBAT: Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) Tool for Battery Energy Storage System Analysis
Overview
The Cyber-Informed Engineering Battery Analysis Tool (CIEBAT) was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER). This tool is first energy source subcomponent integrated into the CIEMAT ecosystem (https://github.com/idaholab/CIEMAT) and is developed to enhance the security and resilience of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) installations by incorporating Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) principles into the deployment of BESS systems.

Systematic Approach
CIEBAT operates through a systematic, multi-step process designed to deliver a thorough and utility-specific analysis:

Analysis of System Services: This initial step(s) involve a detailed selection and examination of the energy system’s operational services.
Consequence-Focused Analysis: In this step(s), the tool guides a user through a CIE consequence analysis to assess the potential impacts of system failures or cyber incidents in relation to organizational risk tolerances.
Cyber-Informed Engineering Mitigation Analysis: In the final step(s), the tool guides a user through a CIE mitigation analysis to identify mitigation opportunities to consider for the microgrid site installation.
